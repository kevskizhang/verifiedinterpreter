# Verified Interpreter with Property-Based Tests

My friends are taking CS 421 Programming Languages and Compilers in fall 2025, but it didn't fit my schedule. Looks like they are working extensively with OCaml, so I thought I'd dip my toes in as well.

Verified Stack VM with Property-Based Testing — built a tiny programming language, a bytecode virtual machine, and an independent “spec” interpreter, then used property-based testing and differential checking to prove the fast VM behaves exactly like the spec across thousands of randomly generated, well-typed programs.
