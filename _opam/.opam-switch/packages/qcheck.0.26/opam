description: """\
QCheck is a QuickCheck inspired property-based testing library for OCaml.

The `qcheck` library provides a compatibility API with older versions of QCheck,
and depends upon both `qcheck-core` and `qcheck-ounit`.

For fewer dependencies and new developments `qcheck-core` is recommended."""
